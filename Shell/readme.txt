1. Place this folder in the home directory (/home/<username>) to make the "save history" feature work correctly.

2. To run the program, press F4 in this folder, copy the lines 5-7 into the terminal and press "Enter":

g++ -Wall -o run-this src/history-manager.hpp src/builtin-manager.hpp src/execution-manager.hpp src/string-processing.hpp src/main.cpp
clear
./run-this

3. Do not delete the "history.txt" file at all cost.
